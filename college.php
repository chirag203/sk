                                    <p><h5>* “As if we are having a jump in the darkness…”</h5></p>
	<p>These were the words uttered by the very founder Shri Nanabhai Bhatt on the occasion of the inauguration ceremony of Lokseva Mahavidyalaya, established as the first humble educational endeavour of our country in form of <span class="highlight ntip" title="Gramvidyapith">‘Gramvidyapith’</span>. It was an enterprise to implement Nai Taleem Education System in Rural Higher Education.
</p>
                                    <p><em>Lokbharti</em> rural higher education institution is unique, pioneer and autonomous in the country since 1953. It is an empirical model of<em>Gandhiji’s</em> vision of basic education – <em>NaiTalim</em>. It promotes a unique, self-reliant lifestyle that strives to improve every aspect of people’s lives in rural India. The main aim of BRS course is to develop a cadre, who has willingness, abilities-skills and appropriate values to work with and for the rural communities to enable them for practising sustainable lifestyle and democratic values to bring prosperity and wellbeing. This outstanding and innovative model of education is a golden gift by legendry (Rushiverya) educationists <em> Shri Nanabhai Bhatt, Shri ManubhaiPancholi, Shri Mulshankar Bhatt and Shri Natavarlal Buch </em>for reconstructing new India to bring true Swaraj after political freedom from British rule.</p>
									<p>It has always been an institution delivering education to address the problems of rural India. It is a movement, a vision in action and rural revolution that imparts higher education to people otherwise unable to access it.</p>
								<p>The outstanding advantages of autonomy are as under:</br>

									<ul>
										<li><strong>Student Admission:</strong></br>While preparing the merit-list for the first year admission on the basis of the marks obtained by the students in HSC examination.</li>
										</br><li><strong>Syllabus:</strong></br>The syllabus of Lokbharati has been always designed keeping a fair balance between Humanities as well as materialistic subjects such as agriculture, Animal Husbandry, Agronomy etc. Having autonomy in re-designing the syllabus, we can update our curriculum as to meet the needs and changes of time and society. While preparing new syllabus or re-designing, experienced experts, educationists, subject specialists, technical expertise and successful alumni students of the institute participate in order to have their valuable suggestions and guidance. A steering committee for the re-designing of present syllabus was formed by the Board of studies last year. At present, such steering committee has been doing required survey and planning to which the study council of Lokbharati also provides guidance.</li>
										</br><li><strong>Hostel/community life:</strong></br>As Lokbharati is a residential Institute, All the students and faculty members along with their families. The philosophy and vision of the institute is to build character by staying together in the campus, so the celebration of festivals, public speeches and programmes are organized with this aim. Here, autonomy has been proved a real boon to us because we can fairly engage the students in such type of system which helps in developing national citizens. It has been also successful in creating a real human being through the education imparted outside the four walls of a class room.</li>								
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p><strong>Correlation with Extension and Research:</strong></br>Extension, Education and Research are the three major aspects of Lok Bharati. The institute organises all the activities in such a way that all these aspects are always interlinked. The institute has taken care of this aspect. Hence, the Wheat Research Work is always accompanied with the students of F.Y.B.R.S (now semester I & II). And S.Y. B.R.S. They help in sowing the seeds, collecting the data, doing the observation and noting down it etc. The students of Animal Husbandry subject join the Animal disease Diagnosis and Treatment camp organised by Goshala (Animal Husbandry and Dairy Department). Students of B.R.S. studying in different years carry out planning, implementation and field work in relation to either farmers' Meet or Women Meetings in surrounding villages, which are adopted under the Ford Foundation Extension Programme. They also arrange their subject related programmes and activities frequently when they visit these villages. Last year, we could arrange the village camp - 'Gramshibir' and Work placement Programme of T.Y.B.R.S. in connection with Total Sanitation Campaign and PURA. The PURA project was a visionary dream of the then Hon' president of our country. The students got an excellent training during such special programmes. Autonomy helps in making co-related education very intense and effective through such type of Extension and Research activities.</p>
								
								<p>
								<strong>Orientation and	retraining of the teachers:</strong>
								<ol>
									<li>In order to sharpen the skills and inspire-the teachers for further study, 'Teachers' stUdy' group' (Karyakar Adhyapan Mandal) is already in existence. All the teachers of Lokbharati have a scope to present their study experiences, views and thoughts on the particular topic.
										</li><li> The institute also arranges special training programmes for Teachers' efficiency Development every' year.
										</li><li> The teacher welfare fund also helps partly by offering the financial assistance in subscribing periodicals The teachers are also given enough facilities and encouraged to attend important programmes out side the campus.
										</li><li> Special arrangements in library have been also done for reading for the teachers They are provided 25 books during the whole year. Special requirements are also considered in this
										respect..
										</li><li> The internet facility of the college is regularly used by the teachers.
										</li><li> The teachers are also given full freedom to purchase new books which are necessary to refer in their respective area of teaching.
										</li>
                                </ol> </p>

																<p><strong>Socially Useful Productive Labour Work</strong></br>Macaulay's Educational System emphasizes on the bookish knowledge which results in only one sided development of the learner, 'Nal Talim' on the other hand stresses upon the all round development of the learner. Education of Lokbharati keeps this idea of integral development in mind. This productive labour is planned keeping in mind its objectives, requirement of the institution and the students skills.<br>
                                          They are as follows:<br>
										  
                                          1. Requirement of the institution and the academy and student's skill for certain specific tasks.<br>
                                          2. Constant one or more than one day labour as per the requirements of agricultural crops.<br>
                                          3. Labour camps (SY) (120 hours of the year) during the season of harvesting.<br>
                                          4. Daily two hour labour to meet daily requirement.<br>
                                          From the first year the daily labour is practised. Thus, Lokseva Mahavidyalaya with this kind of light<br>
                                          exercise makes the student self reliant and as they share the different tasks in groups and their annual<br>
                                          fees are paid from it, so they don't have to pay their educational fees in cash. Each student is assigned productive labour of 650 hours during three years of study.. The remuneration of the labour, as the educational fees, has been sanctioned by Gujarat government.<br>
                                          This type of productive labour is arranged during the whole year which enables the students to be familiar with the activities undertaken by 'Go-shala' 'Nursery', farming, Wheat research, Laboratory, Vigyan Bhavan etc. It also achieves correlation of the activities conducted during the labour with the various subjects of their curriculum. By this programme e.g. students get the information about the section of cleanliness, Science of health, making Silage in 'Go-shala', crops of grass fodder, pasture, various kinds of crop, methods of farming, stages of crop-development, weeding, bacteria contaminating crops, scarcity of water for crop, manure etc. In gardening, they get acquaintances with floral plants of nursery, filling flower pots, grafting, office, flowers, acquaintance, and maintenance of flowering plants, meeting vegetable plants, cleanliness, taking notes regarding climate changes, moisture, temperature, direction of wind &amp; its speed etc.<br>
  &quot;Shram Shibir&quot; (A camp of 10 days) is an important program undertaken in S.Y.B .R.S. in which students are send to different farm family divided a team of 2 students. In this program students are involved with farm family in different agricultural operations and their day to day work and gain the practical experience.<br>
  &quot;Silage Shram&quot; for 6 days is always organized in cattle briding farm for better understanding of the &quot;silage procedure&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation Methodology:</strong></br>The process of evaluation and assessment also gets benefits of the autonomy.
                                        <ol>
                                          <li>
                                            All inclusive, constant and transparent, evaluation is made possible.</li>
                                          <li>The experts and heads of the institutes of outsides also evaluate our students, while they stay for work placement and special subject's educational placement programmes.</li>
                                          <li> Keeping the character building in centre, the hostel life and community life have<br>
                                            also to be included as a part of overall evaluation of the student which sows seeds of moral-social responsibilities among them.<br>
                                            </li>
                                          <li>The students can have a look over their assessed papers and thereby they can<br>
                                            compare their performances with the best written papers. This process gives a chance to them for the removal of their weaknesses and self-analysis</li>
                                          <li>The second mid-term internal exam. can be conducted in different manners, which<br>
                                            may be other than written method. The teachers here find enough chances for experiments and innovative methods. Some of the examples are as under.<br>

                                            <strong>The Hostel —the Best Medium of Character Building:</strong>
                                           Indian community is divided on the bidf racism, caste and distinction between rich and poor. Such narrow mindedness is the hurdle in th &amp; progress. In any nation, community life is the best medium to remove such differences. It is the matter of sharing and caring. As per the UNESCO report- &quot;Learning the Treasure within&quot; 'learning to live together' is an important educational aspect as far as modern society is concerned     Since the very beginning, Lokbharati Lokseva<br>
                                           </br>  Mahavidyalaya has considered Hostel life as a part and partial of education, where students are staying in the same hostel and doing all the works together. Involvement of the student in hostel activities (Community life) is an important aspect of the student's educational progress. Thus, even if a student should have got first class in his examination, but if his community life is found unsatisfactory, he is not allowed to promote to the further class.<br>
                                            </br> There is the reason for giving so much importance to Hostel life, the reason is that mere living together is not enough, but it should lead to natural selfless love, mutual understanding, and co­operation and further it should also develop sense of responsibility for a democratic way of life.<br>
                                           </br>  The students, staying in Lokbharati Hostel, are involved in all kinds of work like preparing food, cleaning, filling up water and other routine work. Of course these duties are done by themselves in rotation, but no one is exempted from it. No peon or other servants are hired for these types of works. The daily schedule of the serving food, cleaning latrines and rooms and sweeping the Hostel and their premises etc. develops their efficiency in work and spirit of self reliance is developed among them Aspects of the Hostel life of Lokbharati are as under.<br>
                                            1. Self reliance.<br>
                                            2. Removal of caste &amp; gender inequality.<br>
                                            3. Development of affection &amp; friendship.<br>
                                            4. Nourishment of good habits.<br>
                                            5. Outdoor community feast.<br>
                                            6. The students union.<br>
                                            7. Selfless affectionate teachers-students relationship.<br>
                                            A special committee has been formed to manage problems of the student staying in Hostel. There are 15 members in above committee which includes rectors of the different hostels, Principals, Directors. The chief rector is the chairman and final decision is left to the Director. Opinion of everyone is taken into consideration. The discussion in the meeting of above committee has been remained always open and academic. According to Gandhian philosophy, true education should develop the abilities of head, hand and heart among students. Lokbharati has proved that, this can be acquired through community life. Hence community life on the campus is harmonious &amp; excellent.</li>
